# Controlling Errors

Errors are used to notify a user when a critical issue has occurred or to log recoverable issues. An error object consists of three mandatory parameters: 

- Error Severity
- Error Category
- Error Code
- Error Custom Data - An optional object with additional information about the issue.

> There are two severities to an error: **critical** and **recoverable**.
> - A critical error is triggered in an error event and is shown to the user as error overlay in the player itself.
> - A recoverable error is not shown to an end user, but appears in the console.

## Error Lists
You'll find the full lists of errors here:
- [Error Severity List](https://github.com/kaltura/playkit-js/blob/master/src/error/severity.js)
- [Error Category List](https://github.com/kaltura/playkit-js/blob/master/src/error/category.js)
- [Error Code List](https://github.com/kaltura/playkit-js/blob/master/src/error/code.js)

## Listening to an Error Event
You can listen to errors the player emits by listening to an '`error`' event as follows:

```javascript
player.addEventListener(player.Event.ERROR, event => {
  const error = e.payload;
  console.log('The error severity is: ' + error.severity);
  console.log('The error category is: ' + error.category);
  console.log('The error code is: ' + error.code);
  console.log('The error data is', error.data);
});
```

## Creating an Error 

If you wish to change / emit an error event, you'll need to create an error object in the following manner:

```javascript
const myError = new Error(
  Error.Severity.CRITICAL, 
  Error.Category.NETWORK,
  Error.Code.HTTP_ERROR,
  {url: 'www.some-bad-url.com'}
  );
```

Next, you'll need to dispatch an `Error` event:
```js
player.dispatchEvent(new FakeEvent(player.Event.Error, myError));
```

> You'll find additional information about dispatching events [here](./events.md).



## Using Debug Mode to See Explicit Error Messages

Use the debug mode in the player to view explicit error messages in the console.

> You'll find additional information about debugging and troubleshooting the player [here](./debugging.md).

## Error Message Example

Here's an example of an error message that can be observed in the console:

    [Error] Player error NETWORK.HTTP_ERROR 'url':'www.some-bad-url.com'
