We refer to the value matched for subexpression <n> as $<n>.\n * For example, matching the above expression to\n * <pre>\n *     http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/uri/#Related\n * </pre>\n * results in the following subexpression matches:\n * <pre>\n *    $1 = http:\n *    $2 = http\n *    $3 = //www.ics.uci.edu\n *    $4 = www.ics.uci.edu\n *    $5 = /pub/ietf/uri/\n *    $6 = <undefined>\n *    $7 = <undefined>\n *    $8 = #Related\n *    $9 = Related\n * </pre>\n * where <undefined> indicates that the component is not present, as is the\n * case for the query component in the above example. Therefore, we can\n * determine the value of the five components as\n * <pre>\n *    scheme    = $2\n *    authority = $4\n *    path      = $5\n *    query     = $7\n *    fragment  = $9\n * </pre>\n *\n * The regular expression has been modified slightly to expose the\n * userInfo, domain, and port separately from the authority.\n * The modified version yields\n * <pre>\n *    $1 = http              scheme\n *    $2 = <undefined>       userInfo -\\\n *    $3 = www.ics.uci.edu   domain     | authority\n *    $4 = <undefined>       port     -/\n *    $5 = /pub/ietf/uri/    path\n *    $6 = <undefined>       query without ?\n *    $7 = Related           fragment without #\n * </pre>\n * @type {!RegExp}\n * @private\n */\ngoog.uri.utils.splitRe_ = new RegExp(\n    '^' +\n    '(?:' +\n        '([^:/?#.]+)' +                  // scheme - ignore special characters\n                                         // used by other URL parts such as :,\n                                         // ?, /, #, and .\n    ':)?' +\n    '(?://' +\n        '(?:([^/?#]*)@)?' +              // userInfo\n        '([^/#?]*?)' +                   // domain\n        '(?::([0-9]+))?' +               // port\n        '(?=[/#?]|$)' +                  // authority-terminating character\n    ')?' +\n    '([^?#]+)?' +                        // path\n    '(?:\\\\?([^#]*))?' +                  // query\n    '(?:#(.*))?' +                       // fragment\n    '$');\n\n\n/**\n * The index of each URI component in the return value of goog.uri.utils.split.\n * @enum {number}\n */\ngoog.uri.utils.ComponentIndex = {\n  SCHEME: 1,\n  USER_INFO: 2,\n  DOMAIN: 3,\n  PORT: 4,\n  PATH: 5,\n  QUERY_DATA: 6,\n  FRAGMENT: 7\n};\n\n\n/**\n * Splits a URI into its component parts.\n *\n * Each component can be accessed via the component indices; for example:\n * <pre>\n * goog.uri.utils.split(someStr)[goog.uri.utils.CompontentIndex.QUERY_DATA];\n * </pre>\n *\n * @param {string} uri The URI string to examine.\n * @return {!Array.<string|undefined>} Each component still URI-encoded.\n *     Each component that is present will contain the encoded value, whereas\n *     components that are not present will be undefined or empty, depending\n *     on the browser's regular expression implementation.
