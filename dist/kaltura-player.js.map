We refer to the value matched for subexpression <n> as $<n>.\n * For example, matching the above expression to\n * <pre>\n *     http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/uri/#Related\n * </pre>\n * results in the following subexpression matches:\n * <pre>\n *    $1 = http:\n *    $2 = http\n *    $3 = //www.ics.uci.edu\n *    $4 = www.ics.uci.edu\n *    $5 = /pub/ietf/uri/\n *    $6 = <undefined>\n *    $7 = <undefined>\n *    $8 = #Related\n *    $9 = Related\n * </pre>\n * where <undefined> indicates that the component is not present, as is the\n * case for the query component in the above example.
