The Kaltura Player utilizes a highly modular approach for creating a powerful media player.
Each functionality of the player is isolated into separate packages, which are designed to deliver a specific set of abilities.
This approach enables extensibility, simplicity and easy maintenance.

The Kaltura Player integrates:

- [PlayKit JS ](https://github.com/kaltura/playkit-js) - The core library.
- [PlayKit JS UI](https://github.com/kaltura/playkit-js-ui) - The UI framework.
- [PlayKit JS DASH](https://github.com/kaltura/playkit-js-dash) and [PlayKit JS HLS](https://github.com/kaltura/playkit-js-hls) for HLS & MPEG-DASH media source extensions capabilities.
- [PlayKit JS IMA](https://github.com/kaltura/playkit-js-ima) for ads and monetization.
- [PlayKit JS Providers](https://github.com/kaltura/playkit-js-providers) as the backend media providers.
- [PlayKit JS Youbora](https://github.com/kaltura/playkit-js-youbora), [PlayKit JS KAnalytics](https://github.com/kaltura/playkit-js-kanalytics), [PlayKit JS KAVA](https://github.com/kaltura/playkit-js-kava), and [PlayKit JS OTT Analytics](https://github.com/kaltura/playkit-js-ott-analytics) as the different analytics plugins.

The Kaltura Player exposes two different players: the _Kaltura OVP Player_ and _Kaltura Cloud TV Player_. Each player integrates its related packages, as you can see in the following table:

|                 | PlayKit JS | PlayKit JS Providers | PlayKit JS UI | PlayKit JS DASH | PlayKit JS HLS | PlayKit JS Youbora | PlayKit JS KAnalytics | PlayKit JS OTT Analytics | PlayKit JS KAVA |
| --------------- | ---------- | -------------------- | ------------- | --------------- | -------------- | ------------------ | --------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------- |
| OVP Player      | V          | OVP                  | V             | V               | V              | V                  | V                     |                          | V               |  |
| Cloud TV Player | V          | OTT                  | V             | V               | V              | V                  |                       | V                        | V (\*)          |
